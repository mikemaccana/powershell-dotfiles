# Mike's Powershell Profile: how to set up a third-party console on Windows if you've been using *nix for 20 years

Heya. I've been using bash for about two decades before getting into Powershell. I'm a *nix person. I've worked at both Red Hat in the early days, IBM's dedicated Linux team, and a bunch of other places working with *nix as an sysadmin, SRE, Architect, and CTO. I now develop node and TypeScript while trying to make [verifying companies for EV HTTPS](https://certsimple.com/help/what-is-ev-ssl) less painful at [CertSimple](https://certsimple.com). 

**If you come from a Linux or Unix background, and want to use Powershell properly, this is the right place.** 

 - Better defaults, like UTF-8 output, long history, better tab completion, adding missing drives for registry hives, and a nice short prompt using the '~' character. See [defaults.ps1](defaults.ps1)
 - Implementations of popular Unix commands. See [unix.ps1](unix.ps1)
 - Useful commands for software development using git. See [development.ps1](development.ps1)
 - Useful commands and settings for node development. See [node.ps1](node.ps1)
 - Useful commands for crypto, including converting between different crypto file types, checking if private keys and certs match, etc. See [openssl.ps1](openssl.ps1)
 - A [config file](terminus-settings.yaml) for [Terminus](https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus), the best Windows terminal.
 
The profile code itself contains useful implementations of common patterns - eg, installing packages, reading the registry, interacting with files and processes. **Learning the basic stuff required to make a profile you're happy with is a great way to get comfortable with Powershell.** 

The details below are minimal, but the names of most commands make things fairly obvious.

## Prerequisities for any *nix user who wants to use Powershell

This is what I install on any Windows 10 box.

### Powershell Core 6.1 (also called Powershell Core 6)

[Powershell Core 6.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/scripting/setup/Installing-PowerShell-Core-on-Windows?view=powershell-6) has a number of useful bits, but the main thing is it starts way faster than Powershell 5, so there's less lag when you open a new tab.

Powershell 6.1 includes PSReadline, which provides history with up/down arrows, other useful vi/emacs keybindings you'll know from bash.

After install, make a shortcut to `"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6\pwsh.exe" -nologo` and pin that to your taskbar. The `-nologo` makes Powershell skip some boring startup messages.

### For a decent, tabbed terminal

#### Tabbed terminals that work now

<img src="misc/terminus.png"/>

 - [**Terminus**](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/) (pictured above) works great, and is **by far my best recommendation for terminals**. Tweaking colors, keyboard shortcuts etc is easy via the menus, and [my settings file is included](terminus-settings.yaml) if you just want my config. 
 - [**Groupy**](https://www.stardock.com/products/groupy/) (paid, 30 day free trial) adds tabs to arbitrary Windows apps. You can combine it with the regular Powershell console to make a tabbed terminal, but it requires more setup than using Terminus. Future builds of Windows will have Sets, a similar feature, built in. 
 - [**ConEmu**](https://conemu.github.io/) also works, but has some contrast issues which make it hard to see the open tab, and is hampered by its author's desire for Windows XP support. 

#### Terminal apps that don't yet work on Windows

The apps below all plan on having Windows support in future, but don't yet properly work at the time of writing. There are links to the tracking bugs below.

 - [**Hyper**](https://hyper.is/) [currently has issues with Ctrl C for Powershell](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/1121). 

 - [**Upterm**](https://github.com/railsware/upterm) [doesn't yet work on Windows](https://github.com/railsware/upterm/issues/800
)

 - [**Alacritty**](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) [is in the early stages of Windows support](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/28)

#### Not a terminal

[cmder](http://cmder.net/)'s website makes it seems like it's a new terminal, but cmder is just ConEmu and some additional things you may already have installed and some other things you don't want (like `cmd` tools).

### Trust PSGallery

To allow you to install items without further prompts:

	Set-PSRepository -name PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted

### For 'less' and a bunch of other useful stuff

Get the [Powershell Community Extensions](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx). Run:

	Install-Module Pscx -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber
	
AllowClobber is needed due to [this bug](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx/issues/15)	

### For 'Remove-ItemSafely' - ie, trashing files from the command line

Run:

	Install-Module -Name Recycle -Scope CurrentUser

### To pick a color scheme / theme

Terminus has it's own color schemes, just open settings and pick one (or use my config file).

Otherwise, the Windows console supports the well know `.itermcolors` format. You can view hundreds of popular themes at [iterm2colorschemes.com](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).

You can edit an `.itermcolors` file using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy). 

[ColorTool](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/08/11/introducing-the-windows-console-colortool/) applies the `.itermcolors` file - it determines coloring for powershell, bash, and cmd. [Download ColorTool from Microsoft's GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/console/tree/master/tools/ColorTool).

Run:

	./colortool -b color-scheme.itermcolors

### For OpenSSH

OpenSSH now comes with Windows. **Settings** -> **Manage Optional Features** -> **OpenSSH client**. 

### For OpenSSL (if you need it)

Personally I use OpenSSL for viewing private keys, pubkeys, certificates, and other TLS/PKI work. Unless you do the same you probably don't need OpenSSL. 

The Windows version of OpenSSH uses Windows CryptoAPI rather than OpenSSL, so if you want to add OpenSSL, you'll have to install it.

Use [this up to date, secure Windows OpenSSL build](https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/). 

### For host, dig and other DNS tools

Download [Bind 9 for Windows](https://www.isc.org/downloads/). Extract the zip and run `BINDinstall.exe` as Administrator. Select 'Tools Only'.

### If you want a better 'select-string' (aka grep)

The [Find-String](https://github.com/drmohundro/Find-String) module adds match highlighting and other fun things. For me the inbuilt `select-string` is enough.

	Install-Module -Name Find-String -Scope CurrentUser

### If you use node

Start [Powershell 5](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools/issues/136) as admin and run:

	npm install -g windows-build-tools

## Minimum Powershell concepts to learn before you rant about how much you hate Powershell

These come with powershell. If you don't know them you're the equivalent of someone who doesn't know `grep` ranting about how "Unix is like DOS". Might be painful to hear but it's true. 

`select` (also called `select-object`) - select the fields you want on an object

`get-member` - show the properties and methods of an object

`get-itemproperty` - show the properties of registry objects (`ls` only shows children)

`where` (also called `where-object`) - choose items matching some criteria.

## How does Powershell actually differ from bash, day-to-day?

Here's a real comparison: [a bash script used to find a compromised node module a little while ago](https://twitter.com/feross/status/1017481175005257728): 

	find . -type d -name "eslint-scope" -print0 | xargs -n 1 -0 -I % sh -c "(cat %/package.json | npx json version) && echo '(at %)'"

Here's [a Powershell version](https://twitter.com/mikemaccana/status/1017774238344900608). This is written using Unix aliases as that's what folk are familiar with, though it's generally considered better to use the full names in your scripts:

	$results = @{} 
	ls -recurse -filter "eslint-scope" | foreach { 
		$file = "${PSItem}\package.json" 
		$version = cat $file | convertfrom-json | select -ExpandProperty version 
		$results.Add($file,$version) } 
	echo $results | format-list

You might prefer one or the other, but the important difference:

 - Powershell has real objects. We're creating a hashmap of `$file`,`$version` pairs.
 - In Powershell we `select` the keys whose values we want, rather than scraping with regexs
 - Powershell seperates content from presentation, so we can format our `$results` however we want
 - Powershell has inbuilt tools to parse JSON (and CSV, and Excel, and other common formats). It can make them too.
